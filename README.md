# CA2_Group4

Basic TCP Server with corresponding GUI


Feedback:
Thought the group project was too similar to our echo project of the previous week, would have enjoyed it more if it was more unique.

Would have enjoyed more time on threads fx. so we don't need to make a new thread for each client connecting to a TCP server.

Big part of the group exercise was the GUI but we got a 20 minute last minute presentation on using swing.

Feedback_2: 
The project was in a way just a continuation of last weeks EchoServer, which resulted in much time being spent on 
minor attributes of the assignment, after having done the essentials. 

A more diverse challenge would have been appreciated, but making the GUI work, and for some reason the deployment aspect
of it was nagging a little bit. Otherwise the communication and work progress worked well in the group.
